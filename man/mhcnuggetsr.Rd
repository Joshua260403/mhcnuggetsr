\title{mhcnuggetsr: estimate the topoplogy of membrane proteins}
\description{
Proteins reside in either the cell plasma of in the
cell membrane. A membrane protein goes through the
membrane at least once. There are multiple ways to span this
hydrophobic layer. One common structure is the transmembrane (alpha)
helix (TMH). Given the amino acid sequence of a membrane protein, this
package predicts which parts of the protein are TMHs
